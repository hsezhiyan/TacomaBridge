# Tacoma Bridge

**Overview**

The following is a simulation I wrote using the numerical method Runge-Kutta order 4 to simulate the effects of wind-based
torsion on a common suspension bridge. The simulation is based off of the real Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which collapsed in 1940 due to violet winds.

Here is a short clip during within the first 10 seconds of start:
